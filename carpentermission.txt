carpenter farmer flow

- farmer and cow not there fence broken,
- speak to carpenter nothing happens there no quest advance but farmer and cow now appear
- speak to farmer cow is talkable carpenter advances to quest 1 with dialogue for going to help farmer

bug happens here - check that everything is being reset if autoexiting
when speaking to carpenter reset all variables before speaking, something is not resetting but only after speaking to carpenter so something is different because there is no exit option in questphbase 0, so look there too

- speak to carpenter for helping, he disappears from carpenter workshop and pliers and nails are collectable and background is updated for cowpath so fence fixed and carpenter placement location is changed to cowPath

- program a  cutscene when returning to farm track conversation between farmer and carpenter and then him leaving to go fishing
